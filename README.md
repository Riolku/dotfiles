# Dotfiles

This is an incomplete list of the changes I made to various tools.

## Sway

Mostly same as the default configuration, added power management commands, hide the bar by default, hide edge borders, add keyboard layouts...

## tofi

Styled it until it looked almost identically to dmenu.

## Waybar

Deleted stuff from the default config until I was happy. Got too lazy to style it.

## Vim

Add a place for system ctags and set sane indenting defaults.

## foot

Modified the Ubuntu theme until it looked nice with Vim & fish.
